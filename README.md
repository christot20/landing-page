Make a landing page with the given layout

Students were given a page layout from the Odin project with a set of colors and font sizes. With this, they were to make a webpage that either copied or followed the format to the best of their ability. I dedicated my page to my favorite video game character Jax from League of Legends. This Project was created from the new HTML and CSS Curriculum from the Odin Project.

1. HTML Semantic Tags and Proper Structure (Head, body, img, span, Footer, Header, etc.)
2. Extensive and much better usage of CSS flexbox and box model.

What I learned:
1. CSS Flexbox to create layouts of different section of a webpage
3. CSS Flexbox and how to design rows/columns effectively and responsively
4. CSS Box Model usage to order specific parts of html into speicifc areas on webpage
5. The use of container divs and better HTML formatting and ordering
6. Version Control and using GIT to save and fix bugs

What's Next:
1. Learn CSS preprocessors like SASS to clean up CSS and create better designs
2. Learn Javascript to add functionality to websites

Project led by The Odin Project.
